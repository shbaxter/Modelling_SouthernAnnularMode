Abstract:

Antarctic sea ice is important for a variety of physical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean. Future anthropogenic forcing is predicted to vastly reduce sea ice extent by the end of the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions are not sufficiently reduced. However, little is known regarding the underlying atmospheric mechanisms and their connection to Antarctic sea ice extent. We investigate the response of sea ice extent to Southern Annular Mode (SAM) UKESM1 CMIP6 simulations across SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios, by examining mean annular and seasonal SAM surface pressures, vertical temperature variations, and wind component changes. The study reveals that the current two-timescale forcing propagates into the future. We also reveal that the SAM shifts to a strong and maintained positive mean state throughout the 21st century in SSP585, with a mean index of 0.88 from 2071 to 2100, potentially contributing to the 50% reduction in sea ice extent by 2100. As a result, anomalously high surface temperatures shift expand and shift polewards, and mean wind currents intensify and contract towards central Antarctica. This report also discusses the limitations of the UKESM1 simulations used in capturing specific climate forcings, such as the lack of representation for direct forcing simulations, and the need for deeper investigation into atmospheric phenomena and sea ice dynamics.

Summary of the UKESM1 GCM:

This report applies the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1.0-LL; “UKESM1”) general circulation model (GCM) developed by the Met Office, using the “r1i1fp1f2” member variant with "historical", "SSP126" and "SSP585" simulation runs (Sellar et al., 2019). UKESM1 is a successor to HADGEM2-ES, built with a lower resolution to HADGEM3-GC3.1 (Robson et al., 2020) at 1.25° x 1.875°, equivalent to almost three grid boxes in most other GCMs (Mulcahy et al., 2022). UKESM1’s extra earth system components and the coupling between them not only improves the capability of UKESM1 in simulating more complex physical and geochemical interactions but also displaying their feedback mechanisms (Sellar et al., 2019), imperative for accurate climate simulations.

The shaded areas represent the standard deviation of each variable. From 1850 to 1960, TAS remains at a steady mean of ~-0.30°C. However, with rapid increases in anthropogenic GHG emissions leads to a rapid rise of TAS by ~0.90°C. b) Same as in a) but plotting SIE with SAM. From 1850-1985, the mean base state of SAM is essentially at equilibrium between its positive and negative inter-annual modes. However, this mean base state starts to tend towards the positive mode from 1990 onwards. Shaded areas display the standard deviation for both figures. The larger standard deviation for SAM is indicative of its high inter-annual variability.</em></p>

SSP126 (4a) surface warming zones between latitudes 60- 72°S are seen shifting polewards when compared to SS585 (4b), consistent with the poleward contraction when comparing 4c and 4d. SSP585 surface winds also show a noticeable strengthening over the high-latitude South America and the west Antarctic Peninsula.
